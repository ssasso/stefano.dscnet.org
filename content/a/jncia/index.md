After a long time, I had the chance to work again with Juniper devices.

To refresh my mind, I took this opportunity to take the JNCIA-Junos course and certification.

I took the course from <a href="https://learningportal.juniper.net/juniper/user_activity_info.aspx?id=JUNIPER-OPEN-LEARNING" target="_BLANK">Juniper Open Learning</a>, and with a couple of weekends of study, and practising with GNS3 (with vSRX, vMX and vQFX), I got my certification.

&nbsp;

I will start again writing some posts about different JunOS labs and configs, so... Stay tuned!
